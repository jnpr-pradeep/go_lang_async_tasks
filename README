The server will run on :8080 port and can be accessed as http://localhost:8080/ and uses the in memory as a database.

It will help to demonstrate the long running (asynchronous tasks).

In this example - every task have 3 starts - Pending, Started, Completed.

Pending - Task will be created with Pending state - Yet start on the processing.
Started - Task status updated after 10sec - Intermediate state
Complete - Indicates completion of the task - after 70 sec of creation.

Start Task:
http://localhost:8080/start_task

Get Task Status:
http://localhost:8080/get_task_stats/{id}

List all the tasks in the system
http://localhost:8080/list_tasks

It uses the inbuilt Go routines with DB (in memory for demo) to bring the Async nature.

How to use the Application:

go run main.go

with the above command server starts and clients can be used from the IE or Chrome (web).
